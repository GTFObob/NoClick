# NoClick

A supplementary extension is still in development. However, if you just want to check out how it works you can try it at https://noclick.herokuapp.com/. 

## Development

To run the project on your computer, first clone the repository and create a virtualenv for the project. (It is recommended that you create and work inside of a python3.6 virtualenv, but you don't necessarily have to)

 Install all of the dependencies by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once pip is finished installing, you can run the application by invoking
```
python app.py
```

The app will then be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## Acknowledgements

Built using Python, [sumy](https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy), Flask, Jinja, SemanticUI and JQuery.
